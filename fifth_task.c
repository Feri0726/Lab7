/* Task description:
Write a function that receives an integer array, and separates the even and the odd elements of the array.
The even elements are put into a second array, and the odd ones are put into a third array; both of them are function arguments, and are assumed to be large enough to store all even and odd elements.

Write a function to print the integer array received as a function parameter!

Write a main function that separates the even and odd elements of an array and prints them to the screen!
